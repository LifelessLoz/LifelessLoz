            <h4>Personal Summary</h4>
            <p>I am a recent university computer science graduate looking to get a foot in the door in the industry.
               I have a strong knowledge of many coding languages and I am continuously looking to improve and develop my skills.
               I am ambitious, highly confident, and can overcome challenges both logically and creatively.
               I am highly flexible and react quickly to new situations.
               My extensive work with children has made me a patient and responsible character who is able to resolve conflicts and disputes.</p>

          <p>Being a Yorkshireman I was destined to either play cricket or rugby, and when my father bought me a cricket bat when I was born the choice was made.
          I've played cricket since I could hold a bat and had the pleasure of playing for several teams throughout my career. Noteable achievements include hitting
          235 runs for Arthington in one game in the 2017 season which at the time was the highest ever in the Nidderdale league by a single player. <br>Playing for Bangor
          University first XI as the opening batsman and wicketkeeper for all 3 seasons and in the 2018 season winning the "Batsman of the Year" and "Players Player" awards.
          <br>I currently play for Pwllheli 1sts in the North Wales Premier League.</p>

          <p>I started playing squash in my first year of university, fell in love and never looked back. I quickly excelled at the sport
          and by my third year at university I was selected as Club Captain for the Squash Society. <br>Representing Bangor university for BUCS Squash Nationals
          as well as captaining the side to a close victory over Aberystwyth in varsity in my final year are two of my proudest achievements in the sport.</p>
